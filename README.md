# IEEE-TeX-Template

A document template in the approximate visual style of an IEEE journal article.

Does not conform directly to IEEE guidelines, as there are official templates for that purpose. I would encourage finding one of those for actual journal articles. This template aims to be a starting point for stand-alone documents with the visual style of such articles.
